Open Items:
1. Connect gameboard DOM with gameboard object's gameboardArray
  - Create DOM that will create dom for player board after run of Gameboard
    -- for each create of div plug in the following data attributes:
      --- data-x
      --- data-y
      --- data-in (data inside gameboardArray)
2. Create DOM.js
  - Creation of gameboard is simultaneous between dom and object
  - All other functions is proposed to be this way:
    -- Executed through DOM.js then simultaneously executing a factory function
