Open Items:
1. Connect gameboard DOM with gameboard object's gameboardArray
  - For fix:
    -- Overlapping ships
  - Helper method for AI
    -- Place ship of AI randomly
  - Function that will update board each turn
    -- hit
    -- miss
    -- sunk
    -- gameover
2. Create DOM.js
  - Creation of gameboard is simultaneous between dom and object
  - All other functions is proposed to be this way:
    -- Executed through DOM.js then simultaneously executing a factory function
